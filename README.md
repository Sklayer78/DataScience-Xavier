Xavier Data Science Summer Internship

Worked with 8 other Xavier Data Science interns to write and analyze code to view the Xavier curiculum. We created ideas for what to look for, delegated groups to work on specific projects and came together to present our findings to Xavier staff. The combined project includes all of the data, which consists of mostly graphs, to learn things such as what majors fulfill core classes, what classes are taken each year/in the summer and many more findings that could be important to improving the core curiculum. 


Campaign 

Worked with 3 Data Science students and 3 Politics students to help campaign for the 2024 Hamilton County Prosecutor election. The data mostly invloves creating maps so we could see what areas had low voter turnout, what preincts tended to have swing voters, what precincts voted specific ways in the past and many more maps. We used this data to contribute our findings to the campaign manager and help with a lot of field work including canvassing. Our findings helped our candidate win the election by a slight margin. We also looked at more data after the election to critique our findings so we can continue to improve our work to be as efficient as possible.
